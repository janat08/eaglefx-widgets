drop down icon fa-fas
test autocomplete on mobile

ask if numbers should round
make custom elements
make styles scoped to custom elements, while making sure to use 
    reusable components so that styles dont get duplicated
make state within function scopes
query symbols doesnt work, all rates are sent: https://exchangeratesapi.io/
go through ux checklist for autocomplete components, and test on chrome,
    also see if up arrow and down arrow could be implemented



mention:
select can't be centered with css alone
there's no example of when to invert the sign


flags are paid, freepick
flags are not manually compiled, therefore there may be mismatch
currency pair wierdness, is reversed in example, top is sold
all currency combinations are included


suggest: 

show two rates in different account, by using split
    inputs
